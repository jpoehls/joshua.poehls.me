I've been studying through Zephaniah recently, prompted by the recently released *[ESV Expository Commentary (Volume 7): Daniel–Malachi](https://www.amazon.com/ESV-Expository-Commentary-7-Daniel-Malachi/dp/1433546523?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=poehls-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f84fa13acb18f9e11c227fc183537e37&camp=1789&creative=9325)*. The commentary on Zephaniah is written by Jason DeRouchie who I've been following since his *[How to Understand and Apply the Old Testament](https://www.amazon.com/How-Understand-Apply-Old-Testament/dp/1629952451?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=poehls-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=3aea9f4d4504f9ceb5bb219392214716&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, which is fantastic.

> Andy Naselli's companion volume, *[How to Understand and Apply the New Testament](https://www.amazon.com/How-Understand-Apply-New-Testament/dp/1629952486?&_encoding=UTF8&tag=poehls-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=1b2956844e522127703e788ed3967077&camp=1789&creative=9325)*, is equally fantastic. I read it first and I'm still working through DeRouchie's volume.

Jason DeRouchie has taught though Zephaniah [several times](https://jasonderouchie.com/a-number-of-studies-on-zephaniah/), including [15 lectures](https://jasonderouchie.com/derouchie-zephaniah-audio-lectures/) given to his adult Sunday School class at Bethlehem Baptist Church in the Fall of 2015. I've compiled the audio recordings from those lectures into a podcast feed for easy listening.
