I recently discovered an excellent narration of the Greek New Testament. It is freely available for download and streaming; the links are below.

- [Stream on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-BfYa4QM2dc&list=PL40D66708671D260F) with text that follows the audio
- [Download the MP3s](http://bit.ly/KoineGreekNT-mp3)
- [Read along at Biblia.com](https://biblia.com/books/tr1894mr)

After finding these recordings on YouTube I had to dig around to find who to cite as the narrator. According to [a post on Glen Scrivener’s blog](https://christthetruth.net/2012/06/23/free-greek-audio-bible/), the narration is by Theo Karvounakis and the recordings are being released into the public domain by he and Matthias Müller.

The readings [are from](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Nwmwi01AWg&lc=UgwXRj1oN5t6C5aKVIx4AaABAg) *Scrivener’s Textus Receptus (1894 edition)* published by the Trinitarian Bible Society, the text of which is also in the public domain.

I’ve listened to a bit from *The Gospel of Matthew* and *The Gospel of John* and the production quality is very good. Theo Karvounakis reads in a modern Greek pronunciation that is easy to understand and listen to.

## The Gospel of John: A Podcast?

I’ve experimented with creating a podcast feed for these recordings so that they are easy to stream on the go. I like to listen to spoken audio in [Overcast](https://overcast.fm) as much as possible because of the excellent Smart Speed and Voice Boost features that trim up the excess silence and enhance the audio quality so much.

I started by making a feed for *The Gospel of John* by uploading the MP3s to the Internet Archive and hosting the podcast RSS feed on GitHub. Use the links below to subscribe. If this is useful to you then I’d love [to hear your feedback](/contact).
