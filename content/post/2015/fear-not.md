I call heaven and earth to record this day against you, that **I have set before you life and death**, blessing and cursing: therefore choose life, that both thou and thy seed may live:[^1]

And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, **choose you this day whom ye will serve**; ...[^2]

**If ye will fear the LORD, and serve him, and obey his voice,** and not rebel against the commandment of the LORD, then shall both ye and also the king that reigneth over you continue following the LORD your God:[^3]

For **God hath not given us the spirit of fear**; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind.[^4]

These things I have spoken unto you, that in me ye might have peace. In the world ye shall have tribulation: but **be of good cheer**; I have overcome the world.[^5]

Ye are of God, little children, and have overcome them: because **greater is he that is in you**, than he that is in the world.[^6]

So that we may boldly say, **The Lord is my helper**, and I will not fear what man shall do unto me.[^7]

**The LORD is on my side;** I will not fear: what can man do unto me?[^8]
