Welcome to my new blog! [^1] All of my blogging in the past has been in the form of longer articles, mostly technology related, and mostly trying to teach a tip or trick.

I'm taking a different approach this time. I'll be posting more random thoughts.
Sharing articles I find interesting. Overall I expect this to feel more like reading my Facebook wall and that's what I'm going for. [^2]

Here goes nothing!

<table border="0" width="100%" style="font-size: 1.5em" class="noborder">
<tr>
<td>Hello World!</td>
<td style="text-align: center;">Hallo Welt!</td>
<td style="text-align: right; direction: rtl;">שלום עולם</td>
</tr>
</table>

[^1]: This is no longer the first post as I've started migrating older content from my blog at `zduck.com`.
[^2]: This is my plan to take control of my public content. I'll still share on Facebook and Twitter, but I want to own the canonical version.
