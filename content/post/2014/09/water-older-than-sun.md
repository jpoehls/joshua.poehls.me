> Astronomers have discovered that much of the water on Earth&mdash;and the solar system&mdash;predates the Sun.

This isn't really surprising, right? I mean, it lines right up with the Genesis creation. Still, thinking about things like this blow my mind.

> <sup>1</sup> In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth.
> <sup>2</sup> And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters.
> <sup>3</sup> And God said, Let there be light: and there was light.[^1]

[^1]: I'm no scholar but I read this as, "Let there be light: and there was the Sun."
