I used to debate this everytime I'd use i.e. or e.g. in my writing. Not anymore!

Right way:

> E.g., this is a proper example.

> I.e., something like this is correct.

Wrong way: [^1]

> e.g., This is a bad example.

Apparently it is also good practice to [include the comma](http://english.stackexchange.com/a/16215).

[^1]: Sadly this is how I've usually written it, except I almost always left off the comma.
