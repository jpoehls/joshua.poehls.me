> High up in the North in the land called Svithjod, there stands a rock.
> It is a hundred miles high and a hundred miles wide.
> Once every thousand years a little bird comes to this rock to sharpen its beak.
> When the rock has thus been worn away, then a single day of eternity will have gone by.
