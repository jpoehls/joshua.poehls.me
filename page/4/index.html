<h3 id="update-on-june-9th-2012:52faea0899fa1d34b0692d951ba2033b">Update on June 9th, 2012</h3>

<p>It is now the year 2012. All of the previous love I had for Silverlight has long since moved on to web standards, specifically HTML5. I don&rsquo;t miss Silverlight, even a little bit.
Even so. I will leave this post around for fun.</p>

<p>&hellip;</p>

<p>Silverlight is at the top of my &ldquo;to learn&rdquo; list this year.
I&rsquo;m already pretty familiar with the basics but now I need
to dig in and write some real apps using it.</p>

<p>This afternoon I decided to outline why I&rsquo;m so excited about
Silverlight. Enjoy.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Cross-platform.</strong> Microsoft supports Silverlight on Windows and Mac.
This is ground breaking for me. I can write applications using .NET and they will
run on a Mac. Score.
<a href="http://www.go-mono.com/moonlight/">Moonlight</a> also enables some
Silverlight support on Linux. As of this writing I believe they support Silverlight 2.</li>
<li><strong>Rapid development.</strong> Not <em>my</em> rapid development but Microsoft&rsquo;s! Microsoft has been
ramping up Silverlight at a phenomenal rate. This says a lot. At the very least it
says Silverlight is here to stay. More than that, it says if Silverlight isn&rsquo;t
a viable medium for your application now&hellip; it probably will be soon.</li>
<li><strong>Web technology.</strong> I&rsquo;ve ventured into WinForms and desktop apps since my beginnings
as a web developer, but I still favor the always up-to-date, easy deployment and
lack of client install that web applications offer. Being a web technology,
Silverlight brings all this to the table.</li>
<li><strong>User experience and easy UI building.</strong> Another reason I prefer web apps is that I
prefer building my UI in HTML/CSS instead of with WinForms/GDI. Designing a unique and creative UI
in WinForms is very difficult. Restyling controls, complex layouts, and theming an application
are all painful in WinForms but very natural and easy with HTML/CSS.</li>
</ul>

<p>XAML is what makes this so much better in Silverlight. The often annoyingly verbose
   syntax aside, you get all the easy creativity and power of HTML/CSS.
*  <strong>Offline and out of browser.</strong> Silverlight apps can be installed to run offline
   and out of browser on users&rsquo; machines. Remember, this isn&rsquo;t just on Windows, either.
   Mac and Linux users get to share the love. This is the feature that makes me
   say Auf Wiedersehen to WinForms and even WPF. Not only do I get
   all the deployment and easy update benefits of a web app, but I can also interact with
   the user&rsquo;s desktop, have shortcuts, file associations, and drag &amp; drop, just like a native
   application.</p>

<p>WPF may be the next WinForms, but for me, Silverlight is the next WinForms and the next ASP.NET.
Sure Silverlight won&rsquo;t work for everything but this year I&rsquo;m hoping
to make Silverlight my MasterCard. As in, &ldquo;&hellip;for everything else, there&rsquo;s <del>MasterCard</del> Silverlight.&rdquo;</p>

    <p>While I was updating this blog to use <a href="http://www.jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>,
I wanted to enable some nice syntax highlighting for any code snippets I may post.
Jekyll provides support for this through <a href="http://pygments.org/">Pygments</a> which is
a pretty mature and widely used syntax highlighter built on Python.</p>

<p>I find it a little ironic that I need to install Python to enable a feature in a Ruby program.
Though it is nice to see that the Jekyll team isn&rsquo;t afraid to leverage great tools even if they
aren&rsquo;t written in Ruby.</p>

<p>I should note that this is my first experience doing anything with Python. That said, here
are the steps I fumbled through to install Pygments. This is officially the first
Python egg I&rsquo;ve ever hatched.</p>

<p>What the heck is an egg? Eggs are one way to package up
a group of Python scripts for easy distribution. This makes
eggs the equivelant of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RubyGems">Ruby gems</a>.</p>

<p>To create or install eggs you need to have
<a href="http://pypi.python.org/pypi/setuptools">easy_install</a> installed.</p>

<p>Here are the steps I took to do that.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download ez_setup.py from <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py">http://peak.telecommunity.com/dist/ez_setup.py</a>
&gt; <strong>Note:</strong> The official documenation for easy_install can be found at
&gt; <a href="http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall">http://peak.telecommunity.com/DevCenter/EasyInstall</a>.</p></li>

<li><p>From the command line run: <code>python ez_setup.py</code>.
This will put an easy_install.exe file (and related scripts) in your <code>C:\Python2x\Scripts</code> folder.</p></li>
</ol>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> If your Python scripts folder is not already in your
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)">PATH environment variable</a> you
may want to add it. This will make it easier to run scripts from that directory later on.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Now that easy_install is available, I can download and install the Pygments egg that I need.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Download the latest Pygments egg for your version of Python from <a href="http://pygments.org/download">http://pygments.org/download</a></p></li>

<li><p>From the command line run: <code>easy_install Pygments-x.y.z-pyX.egg</code>.</p></li>

<li><p>This will put add a &lsquo;pygmentize&rsquo; script to your default Python scripts folder (probably C:\Python2x\Script).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>And that&rsquo;s it. Of course after going through all of that I discovered that
there is <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/#issue/76">a bug</a> in
the current release of Jekyll that breaks its pygments support on Windows.
Fortunately someone has fixed this bug in <a href="http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/issues/#issue/76">a fork of Jekyll</a>
but I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to trying that out yet. So for now I have no fancy syntax highlighting, but I did learn
how to install an egg!</p>

        </p>
    </header>

    

<p>The other night I received a recommendation to try out Dropbox.
If you don&rsquo;t know what Dropbox is, here&rsquo;s the short of it.
Post-install, you&rsquo;ll see a &ldquo;My Dropbox&rdquo; folder on your desktop
(or wherever you chose to place it) and anything you put in there gets
automagically sync&rsquo;d with every other computer you have Dropbox installed on.</p>

<p>From random documents and OneNote Notebooks to my <a href="http://www.keepass.info">Keepass</a>
Database and books I&rsquo;m reading, I have quite a few files that I like to
have access to no matter which computer I&rsquo;m on. I could use a thumb drive
for this&hellip; and I have in the past, but the convenience of having everything
synchronized automatically for me and not having to remember to carry
around the thumb drive is too much to pass up.</p>

<p>For the past 6 months or so I&rsquo;ve been using Windows Live Mesh to
synchronize these files between my computers. Before that I was
using Windows Live Sync. I&rsquo;m actually still using Live Sync for
some things (more on that later) but I have made the switch from Mesh
to Dropbox. Bottom line, Dropbox &ldquo;just works&rdquo; and it keeps me in the
loop while it&rsquo;s doing it. Let me explain.</p>

<h2 id="windows-live-mesh:25abb50c96c42cf7d95495da7fca694d">Windows Live Mesh</h2>

<p>This is Microsoft&rsquo;s vision for your personal cloud.
You get 5GB of online storage known as your Live Desktop.
You get file synchronization between your computers (just like Live Sync).
And you get remote desktop baked in.</p>

<p>Mesh is still a beta product and things seem to be moving slowly
on it judging by the sparse updates and lack of news via the blogging community.</p>

<p><figure >

<img src="/2009/10/livemesh-dropbox/mesh_live_desktop.jpg"  />


</figure></p>

<p>The best part of Mesh is that in addition to syncing folders
across your computer, you can <em>optionally</em> have it sync the folder
to your Live Desktop. Anything in your Live Desktop is available from any
web connected computer and this is very handy. Don&rsquo;t miss the key word though.
<strong>Optional</strong>. This is very important because I may have 20+ GB of music that
I want to sync between my computers, but I don&rsquo;t want that eating
up my 5GB of cloud space. With Mesh, this is easily handled by configuring
exactly which devices you want to sync each folder with. Guess what?
Your Live Desktop shows up as a device!</p>

<p><figure >

<img src="/2009/10/livemesh-dropbox/mesh_folder_share_config.png"  />


</figure></p>

<p>What&rsquo;s the catch? Well for me the whole syncing part was too opaque.
I never felt like I really &lsquo;knew&rsquo; if my latest changes had been sync&rsquo;d
yet or not. Even with the fancy News sidebar that Mesh attaches to each
of your sync&rsquo;d folders.</p>

<p><figure >

<img src="/2009/10/livemesh-dropbox/mesh_log_small.jpg"  />


</figure></p>

<p>All too often I would update files and trust Mesh to sync them only
to find out later that Mesh never picked up on the changes. Maybe it&rsquo;s
just the fancy UI they&rsquo;ve given it, but I don&rsquo;t feel like the News pane
is giving me all the details about which files have been uploaded, when,
and which ones are still in progress.</p>

<p>Maybe if Mesh had been faithful in keeping my files in sync I wouldn&rsquo;t
care about seeing these details. Unfortunately it failed me and now I want
to see everything.</p>

<p>I only used the built in remote desktop a couple of times but I was
impressed that it worked pretty well, even when the computer I was connecting
to was behind a proxy.</p>

<h2 id="dropbox:25abb50c96c42cf7d95495da7fca694d">Dropbox</h2>

<p>Whereas Mesh and Live Sync allow you to synchronize multiple folders
between your computers, Dropbox only syncs one folder. Your My Dropbox folder.
This was a small adjustment for me to make but it was worth it.</p>

<p>Dropbox is completely cross platform with support for Windows, Mac, Linux,
iPhone and other mobile phones. I only care about Windows and the iPhone though.</p>

<p>I get 2GB free from Dropbox which is plenty for my critical files.
Unlike Mesh, you can&rsquo;t choose to <em>not</em> have some files sync&rsquo;d to the cloud.
Everything in your My Dropbox goes to the cloud, as well as your other computers.
This is the only thing that I see Mesh having an upper hand in and its
actually the reason I&rsquo;m still using Live Sync for some things.</p>

<p>The Windows client for Dropbox is perfect. I get status overlays on all
of the files and folders in My Dropbox that indicates whether they are
up-to-date or downloading (+1 for acting like TortoiseSVN!). I get real-time
balloon messages from my notification area whenever a file is changed, even
when it&rsquo;s on another computer. For instance if I update a file on my desktop,
I&rsquo;ll get a notification as soon as my laptop receives the update. This does
wonders for making me feel &ldquo;in the loop&rdquo; and confident that my files are being
kept up-to-date.</p>

<p><figure >

<img src="/2009/10/livemesh-dropbox/dropbox_status_overlays.png"  />


</figure></p>

<p>Dropbox has the cloud part covered by letting you login and access all your
files via the browser. On top of this, they also keep past versions of your
files (think shadow copy) as backups.</p>

<p>The iPhone application (free) is a real work of art. I expected slow and
clunky and I got fast and simple. Once you login you see a list of all your
files and folders alphabetized. If its a file type that the iPhone supports
(i.e photos or Office docs) you can open it up right on your phone. You can
also add photos to your dropbox from your iPhone.</p>

<p>Of course all of these apps offer great support for sharing files with
your friends and colleagues, but Dropbox offers one stand out feature here.
In addition to being able to share specific folders with friends, they give
you a built-in Public folder that you can drop any file into, then right-click
on the file to select an option to Copy a Public Link to that file. You can
send this link to anyone and they&rsquo;ll be able to access the file. This enables
a very quick workflow for sharing documents.</p>

<h2 id="windows-live-sync:25abb50c96c42cf7d95495da7fca694d">Windows Live Sync</h2>

<p>This one has been around for awhile and (unlike Mesh) its <em>not</em> a beta.
Also unlike Mesh, this one hasn&rsquo;t lost my confidence.</p>

<p>There is no cloud storage with Live Sync. It only syncs directly between
your computers peer-to-peer style. This means to stay up to date your
computers really need be online all the time. When you change a file on
computer A it checks if computer B is online and if so it will upload
directly from A to B. If computer B is offline, it doesn&rsquo;t get the update.
When computer B comes back online it will look for updates from A, if A is
offline it won&rsquo;t get updates until it comes back.</p>

<p>Oh, and it has an activity log:</p>

<p><figure >

<img src="/2009/10/livemesh-dropbox/live_sync_activity.png"  />


</figure></p>

<p>No cloud storage means no piddly size limitations. Well, sort of.
You are limited to syncing 20 folders (top-level folders, this doesn&rsquo;t
include children) with up to 20,000 files in each. I&rsquo;m not sure what the
per-file size limits are.</p>

<p>I mentioned above that I&rsquo;m still using Live Sync in addition to Dropbox.
This is for 2 reasons:</p>

<ol>
<li>I have a <code>C:\tools</code> folder that I want to sync. I don&rsquo;t want this
to become <code>C:\My Dropbox\tools</code>.</li>
<li>I have some larger files (like music) that I don&rsquo;t care if its
stored in the cloud, I just want it sync&rsquo;d. If I used Dropbox
for this my free storage limits would have run out within the first hour&hellip;</li>
</ol>

<p>At the end of the day, if you need to sync files between computers,
I highly recommend either Dropbox or Windows Live Sync. As for Live Mesh?
This is admittedly still a BETA product and it acts like one. I&rsquo;d wait until
it&rsquo;s more mature before going this route.</p>

            </a>
        </p>
    </header>

    <p>So out of all the things I don&rsquo;t know, PowerShell is the one thing that made it to the top of my To Learn stack. Last week I ordered <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Windows-PowerShell-Action-Bruce-Payette/dp/1932394907/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-7531966-1417704?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1177382702&amp;sr=8-1">PowerShell In Action</a>, it hasn&rsquo;t arrived yet but I&rsquo;ve already read about 100 pages out of the PDF (don&rsquo;t ask). The book is very well written and describes the core concepts of PowerShell very well.</p>

<p>Having (almost) never written a batch file in my life it is taking a bit for me to wrap my head around the basics but so far I love it. Compiling C# apps to do simple tasks like iterate directory structures and process files has always annoyed me. There is just too much overhead in having to compile and manage both the source code an executable when you only need the code once (until tomorrow comes).</p>

<p>I just want to create a script and run it. No compilation, no exe. Oh, and since I&rsquo;ve been completely spoiled by the .NET Framework I want access to all that too. PowerShell fits the bill.</p>

<p>My first task. Find all files with an extension of <code>*.bak</code> on my <code>C:\</code> drive and delete them.</p>

<pre><code>#  move to C: drive
cd c:\

#  list all files in C:
dir

#  list all *.BAK files in C:
dir *.BAK

#  do it recursively
dir -recurse -filter *.BAK
</code></pre>

<p>Ok, so now that I&rsquo;ve got PowerShell spinning through my entire <code>C:\</code> drive, how do I stop it? You can always kill the process but I was in a pretty good mood today and decided to be nice. This is likely to be one of the most important things you learn about PowerShell so remember it well&hellip;</p>

<p><code>CTRL+C</code></p>

<p>That will halt execution of whatever PowerShell is doing and get you back to a prompt. Very handy for people like me who like tend to hit <code>[Enter]</code> before thinking about how long it might take to run.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> <code>dir</code> (along with <code>ls</code>) is just an alias for the <code>Get-ChildItem</code> command.<br />
You can get the full syntax for this command by running <code>Get-Help dir</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And if you want to delete all those <code>*.BAK</code> files you just found? Just pipe your <code>dir</code> to <code>del</code> (which is an alias for <code>Remove-Item</code>).</p>

<p><code>dir -recurse -filter *.BAK | del</code></p>

<p>How often do you write cmdlets that operating on files? Probably all the time. You may be tempted to simply use a <code>[string]</code> type for your file path parameter but you may be missing a few things that really make this work well.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s cover a few downsides to using <code>[string]</code> as your parameter type.</p>

<ul>
<li>You can&rsquo;t pipe multiple file paths to your cmdlet. Using an array <code>[string[]]</code> will fix this.</li>
<li>You can&rsquo;t (easily) pipe output from <code>Get-ChildItem</code> into your cmdlet.</li>
</ul>

<p>There are other complexities you may not be thinking about as well.</p>

<ul>
<li>Do you resolve relative paths?</li>
<li>Do you support <code>-LiteralPath</code>?</li>
<li>Do you support wildcard paths?</li>
<li>What if you want to accept paths that are file system paths? That is, paths from other PSProviders?</li>
</ul>

<p>The goal of this post is to show you how to write a cmdlet that accepts <code>-Path</code> and <code>-LiteralPath</code> parameters in a way consistent with the behavior of the built-in cmdlets such as <code>Test-Path</code> and <code>Get-ChildItem</code>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s get started. I&rsquo;ll show you how to do this in a PowerShell cmdlet first, then in a C# cmdlet. [Skip ahead to the C#][c#] if that&rsquo;s what you need.</p>

<p>Credit where credit&rsquo;s due. I gathered most of this information from <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/8506768">an excellent post</a> on StackOverflow.</p>

<h2 id="parameter-sets:9df8720b825f99b4b33cb05e86fdb78e">Parameter Sets</h2>

<p>If you want to accept either <code>-Path</code> or <code>-LiteralPath</code> parameters then you&rsquo;ll need to separate them into their own [parameter sets][parameter_sets]. The idea here is that you want to only accept one or the other, not both.</p>

<pre><code>[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(
        ParameterSetName = &quot;Path&quot;
    )]
    [string[]]$Path,

    [Parameter(
        ParameterSetName = &quot;LiteralPath&quot;
    )]
    [string[]]$LiteralPath
)
</code></pre>

<p><code>[CmdletBinding()]</code> is necessary to turn this into an [advanced function][advanced_function]. This let&rsquo;s use use the <code>[Parameter]</code> attribute.</p>

<h2 id="piping-from-get-childitem:9df8720b825f99b4b33cb05e86fdb78e">Piping from <code>Get-ChildItem</code></h2>

<p>You may be surprised that piping <code>Get-ChildItem</code> to your cmdlet doesn&rsquo;t work. The reason is that <code>Get-ChildItem</code> returns <code>FileInfo</code> and <code>DirectoryInfo</code> objects, not strings. You work around this by accepting pipeline input by property name.</p>

<pre><code>[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(
        ParameterSetName  = &quot;Path&quot;,
        ValueFromPipeline = $true,
        ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true
    )]
    [string[]]$Path,

    [Parameter(
        ParameterSetName = &quot;LiteralPath&quot;,
        ValueFromPipeline = $true,
        ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true
    )]
    [string[]]$LiteralPath
)
</code></pre>

<p>Now our parameters accept input from the pipeline and piping input from <code>Get-ChildItem</code> works as we&rsquo;d expect.</p>

<h2 id="relative-paths:9df8720b825f99b4b33cb05e86fdb78e">Relative Paths</h2>

<p>Typically you&rsquo;ll want to resolve any relative paths before processing them, here&rsquo;s how you might do that.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note: <code>Resolve-Path</code> will throw an exception for paths that don&rsquo;t exist.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre><code>if ($PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -eq &quot;Path&quot;) {
    $paths = Resolve-Path -Path $Path |
                select -ExpandProperty Path
}
elseif ($PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -eq &quot;LiteralPath&quot;) {
    $paths = Resolve-Path -LiteralPath $LiteralPath |
                select -ExpandProperty Path
}
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>$paths</code> variable now contains fully resolved paths.</p>

<h2 id="powershell-cmdlet:9df8720b825f99b4b33cb05e86fdb78e">PowerShell Cmdlet</h2>

<p>After we put it all together, here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>

<pre><code>[CmdletBinding()]
param(
    [Parameter(
        ParameterSetName  = &quot;Path&quot;,
        ValueFromPipeline = $true,
        ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true
    )]
    [string[]]$Path,

    [Parameter(
        ParameterSetName = &quot;LiteralPath&quot;,
        ValueFromPipeline = $true,
        ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName = $true
    )]
    [string[]]$LiteralPath
)

process {
    if ($PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -eq &quot;Path&quot;) {
        $paths = Resolve-Path -Path $Path |
                    select -ExpandProperty Path
    }
    elseif ($PSCmdlet.ParameterSetName -eq &quot;LiteralPath&quot;) {
        $paths = Resolve-Path -LiteralPath $LiteralPath |
                    select -ExpandProperty Path
    }

    # TODO: Insert cmdlet logic here.
}
</code></pre>

    <p>Spending all day looking at the default color schemes in Visual Studio started
making me go buggy-eyed several months ago. Mostly it was the white
background - just way to bright for a programmer who does his best work in the dark.</p>

<p>So&hellip; taking cues from <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ChangingYourColorsInVisualStudioNETBlackVersusWhite.aspx">others</a>
who have &lsquo;gone black&rsquo; with their color scheme, I set out to customize my coding environment.
The result? See for yourself&hellip; here is the color scheme I did for SQL Management Studio.
I&rsquo;ll post my VS.NET settings later but they are pretty similar.</p>

    <p>I&rsquo;ve been looking a lot at Ruby on Rails lately, and one of the things
that really stands out to me are the
<a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UnderstandingMigrations">migrations</a>.
Migrations is the Rails way of defining your database schema in such a way that it is easy to:</p>

<ul>
<li>put into source control</li>
<li>shared between developers</li>
<li>rollback or upgrade to any version of the schema from any version</li>
</ul>

<p>Plenty of info is available about migrations on at the Ruby on Rails website
so I won&rsquo;t duplicate that here. I do recommend reading the basics on
<a href="http://wiki.rubyonrails.org/rails/pages/UnderstandingMigrations">how RoR migrations work</a>
before continuing.</p>

<p>Suffice to say I wanted something like this to use with my .NET applications pretty bad.
I searched around and couldn&rsquo;t find anything like this for .NET (without
jumping into some full blown OR/M) so I made one myself.</p>

<p>I call it &ldquo;DotNetMigrations&rdquo; and it&rsquo;s as close to the RoR version of migrations
as I could make it. The biggest difference is that your migration script is real
T-SQL instead of Ruby. This is actually a big plus in the .NET/SQL Server world
since you can just open your script in SQL Management Studio to test it, and
copy/paste the scripts Studio generates for you to create your migration scripts.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a screenshot from the app with basic usage examples:</p>

<p><a class="lightbox img" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uTRG_A-YdZY/SBEDtvhLfFI/AAAAAAAABf4/LjHlzRMz8N8/s1600-h/DotNetMigrations_usage.png">
    <img src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_uTRG_A-YdZY/SBEDtvhLfFI/AAAAAAAABf4/LjHlzRMz8N8/s400/DotNetMigrations_usage.png" /></a></p>

<p>&hellip; and here&rsquo;s the readme file:</p>

<pre><code>README
-------------------

Run db.exe to see usage information.

All migration scripts are stored underneath the current working directory in: /migrate/

Connection strings to your database can be stored in the db.exe.config file.
Connection strings in this file can be referenced by name when executing commands on db.exe.

A [dbo].[schema_info] table will be created inside the database.
This table is used to store the current schema version and will be updated
whenever you run the 'migrate' command.
</code></pre>

<p>Of course everything the application does is wrapped in transactions so if at any
point during a migration an error occurs (i.e. some goof-ball screwed up the migration script)
it will roll back to the original version of the database.</p>

<p>Since your migration script is just T-SQL you can do anything from create tables and
add columns to doing data transformations. And assuming your scripts are well written,
you&rsquo;ll be able to transform your database to/from any version of the schema at anytime.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m considering creating a Google Code project for this if there&rsquo;s enough interest. Thoughts?</p>

    <p>This is my first comic strip, inspired by a random spurt of creativity.
I can&rsquo;t take all the credit though. The fantastic &lsquo;lettering&rsquo; was done
by a very good friend ;)</p>

<p><a class="lightbox img" title="Comic" href="{{site.url}}/assets/forposts/comic/JK-comic-1.jpg">
    <img src="{{site.url}}/assets/forposts/comic/JK-comic-1-small.jpg" alt="comic" />
</a></p>

<p>If you can&rsquo;t make it out, here&rsquo;s a blow-by-blow description&hellip;</p>

<p>The comic depicts an inspector looking at a tank that is structurally insecure.
During his inspection, the tank falls on him and begins to roll down the hill,
snowballing with the inspector on it.</p>
